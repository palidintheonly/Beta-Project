cd monkeybytes-auth-bot
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install discord.js express express-session passport passport-discord fs path
```

3. Edit the configuration in the source code:

// Find and edit the config object in monkeybytes-auth-bot.mjs
const config = {
  clientId: 'Get your own Discord client ID',
  clientSecret: 'Get your own Discord client secret',
  token: 'Get your own Discord bot token',
  // Other configuration values...
};
```

4. Start the bot
```bash
node monkeybytes-auth-bot.mjs
```

## ⚙️ Setting Up Discord Application

1. Create a new application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Under the "Bot" tab, create a bot and enable:
   - Presence Intent
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent

3. Under "OAuth2" > "URL Generator":
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Select permissions: `Manage Roles`, `Send Messages`, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Add Reactions`
   - Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server

4. Configure redirect URLs:
   - Add your OAuth2 redirect URL (e.g., `http://your-server-url:20295/auth/callback`)

## 📝 Required Channels

The bot needs these channels to be set up (IDs configured directly in the code):
- Verification category
- Verification channel (where users click to verify)
- Staff approval channel (for approval requests)
- Log channel (for activity logs)
- Resources channel (for saved resources)
- Heartbeat channel (for service status updates)
- Uptime logs channel (for uptime reporting)

## 💾 Database

The bot uses a file-based database system storing data in:
- `./monkey-verified-users.json` - User verification data
- `./monkey-uptime-history.json` - Uptime tracking

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the bot's appearance and messages by editing these variables in the configuration section of the code:

```javascript
const config = {
  // ... other config
  embedColor: '#3eff06',
  embedFooter: '© MonkeyBytes Tech | The Royal Court',
  welcomeMessage: "🎉 Welcome message...",
  verificationMessage: "To join the MonkeyBytes court...",
  // ... other config
};
```

## 🏭 Running in Production

For production use, it's recommended to use a process manager like PM2:

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start the bot with PM2
pm2 start monkeybytes-auth-bot.mjs --name monkeybytes-auth

# Make it start on system boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

Staff can also use the `/restart` and `/stop` commands within Discord to manage the bot's lifecycle.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- The bot implements basic security headers for the web interface
- Session management with secure cookies
- IP filtering for sensitive endpoints
- Role-based access control for staff commands

**⚠️ Important:** Make sure to get your own Discord credentials before deploying.
