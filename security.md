# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our MonkeyBytes Discord Bot seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our code, please report it to us by emailing [security@monkeybytes.example.com](mailto:security@monkeybytes.example.com).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please follow these steps:

1. Email your findings to [security@monkeybytes.example.com](mailto:security@monkeybytes.example.com)
2. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Response Policy

When you report a vulnerability to us, we commit to:

- Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days
- Provide an initial assessment of the report within 10 business days
- Keep you informed about our progress resolving the issue
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed

## Security Update Process

Security updates for this Discord bot will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is discovered and fixed. Updates will be published as new releases on the repository.

## Known Security Issues and Fixes

### Token Security

**Issue:** Publishing code with hardcoded bot tokens to public repositories presents a significant security risk.

**Warning:** Never publish your code to public repositories or share it openly when it contains hardcoded bot tokens. This could lead to unauthorized access to your bot and potentially compromise your Discord server.

**Recommendation:** Before sharing or publishing code, either:
- Remove the token and replace it with a placeholder
- Make the repository private
- Use a .gitignore file to exclude configuration files with sensitive information

**Example of code prepared for sharing:**
```javascript
// Replace this with your actual token when deploying
const token = 'REDACTED'; 
```

**Important:** When deploying your bot, you must replace 'REDACTED' with your actual Discord bot token. The token shown in the original code has been redacted for security purposes. Your bot won't function properly until you insert your own valid token that you can obtain from the Discord Developer Portal.

### Potential Data Exposure

**Issue:** The web management interface doesn't implement authentication, potentially exposing message logs and other data.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper authentication for the web management interface using methods such as JWT tokens, session-based authentication, or OAuth2 integration with Discord.

### File System Security

**Issue:** The bot stores logs directly to the file system without input validation.

**Recommendation:** Validate and sanitize data before writing to files, and implement proper file permissions.

## Security Best Practices for Bot Operators

1. **Code Sharing**: Never publish code with hardcoded tokens to public repositories. If you need to share your code, replace sensitive values with placeholders first.

2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot and its dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure the bot has only the permissions it needs to function, both in terms of Discord permissions and system access.

4. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for any management interfaces.

5. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS for any web communications.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Maintain comprehensive logs of bot activities and set up monitoring to detect unusual behavior.

7. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of bot commands.

8. **Input Validation**: Validate all input from users to prevent injection attacks.

9. **Regular Backups**: Back up bot data regularly and securely.

10. **Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your bot's code and configuration.

## Updates to this Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the version number at the top of this document.
